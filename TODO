# To-Do List
- Notes: Firebase can take references and accounts for newline characters
- Timezone changes
- Clarify that quizzes are 10 questions, not 5

- Write down every possible place for error, and type of error handling
- Embed One Minute Sanskrit videos in hint pages
- Social Sign In (seamless flow)

## Pilot Program and Accounts
- The user can sign up for the Beginner or Advanced quiz level, each with different weekly quizzes
  - Brand new users: will set their quiz level during sign up
  - Verified users: will set their quiz level after signing in **between AuthPage and AppNav** with a popup that cannot be dismissed
    - They will then be signed out (with points and data reset) and info updated
- After the pilot program, users will choose their account type after they verify their email
  - The classroom list is fetched, which contains its ID and list of quizzes; if the user enters a valid classroomID, then the quizzes, users, and hint pages are fetched
  - The quizzes are split by public and private collections
    - Public collections accessible by most teachers but only modifiable by teachers with admin access codes
    - Private collections are modifiable by only teachers and their personal collections
- To speed up document reads after things start to scale up, create a script that exports user data to a Google Sheet and then deletes the data in Firestore



## Multiple Quiz Formatting and Accounts
- All visible quizzes are going to be in a home page, displayed with an array
  - Whether a quiz is visible depends on its "show" value in the database and whether the quiz is mastered
    - This will be controlled by an admin account (to add later on)
      - Admins can also write new quizzes to the database

- There will be two types of accounts: students and admins (to add later on), both will have profiles
  - Will need to add "classrooms" that students can join
    - The same quizzes will be shown to all students in the same classroom
    - Admins control a classroom (and access student data?)

## Quiz Mastery
- Quizzes can be mastered
  - To complete a quiz, the user will answer all questions correctly twice
    - Only 5/10 questions can be done a day
    - 5 points each time a question is answered correctly, and an extra 5 points when it's mastered
  - The quiz is first shown at a given set time, with the first 5 questions, which stays until the session is complete
    - If the session was completed  

- 5-question sets are managed as sessions, with data tracked for the current session. Each time the user comes to the home page from the quiz page, an algorithm is run to see which questions should be shown.
  - If a session is incomplete (current question is not 5 or 10), the current session continues till its end
    - If a session is complete, then next session is shown with all questions answered correctly <2 times
  - The home page will show the number of questions remaining in a session (number) and the number of questions mastered (progress bar).
  - The summary page is shown after every session (5 questions). It is slightly different when a quiz is mastered.

## Stretch Goals
- Advanced UI and animations (like TutorialPopUp)
  - Allow users to select a profile icon and display them on the leaderboard
- Improve the optimization of loading/saving quizzes and users (don't change database if no Qs answered)
  - Saving cache to avoid reading the database every time
- Reauthenticate before changing password or deleting account
- Allow custom number of questions in quizzes and sessions and custom session start times
- Question variety beyond multiple choice, multimedia support for questions
- Allow more questions, custom sessions, and custom quiz release time

 # Notes
 ## State Management
- ChangeNotifier class added to a state class to store fields for all widgets to access and methods with notifyListeners().
- ChangeNotifierProvider is the widget that provides an instance of ChangeNotifier, added in the main method (MultiProvider if multiple classes needed).
```void main() {
  runApp(
    ChangeNotifierProvider(
      create: (context) => MyAppState(),
      child: const MyApp(),
    ),
  );
}
```

- MyAppState() is an example of a "model", which are similar to helper classes/objects in OOP.

- These are different methods to use ChangeNotifier. Each one has tiny differences but many can be interchanged in most cases. Internet recommends using context.read() and context.watch().
<br /><br />
```
final model = context.read\<MyAppState\>();
```
- This returns the Model without listening for any changes.
- Used when CHANGING a state but not ACCESSING it (or only accessing it once).
<br /><br />

```
final model = context.watch\<MyAppState\>();
```
- This makes the widget listen for changes on the Model.
- Used to ACCESS state throughout changes.
<br /><br />

```
final model = Provider.of\<MyAppState\>(context, listen: false);
```
- This works the same as context.read\<MyAppState\>();
<br /><br />

```
final model = Provider.of\<MyAppState\>(context);
```
- This works the same as context.watch\<MyAppState\>();
<br /><br />

```
Consumer\<MyAppState\>(
    builder: (context, stateVar, child) {
        return Text('${stateVar.value}');
    }
)
```
- This works the same as context.watch\<MyAppState\>();

## Asynchronous Coding:
Asynchronous (async) coding allows a Flutter App to run while waiting on that section of the code to finish. For example, if a method was downloading an image, Flutter can continue running other code while the image downloads, then comeback to finishing that method.
- Such methods use Future\<T\> values. Future values have two states: uncompleted and completed (with a value or an error). Async coding is about handling these different states. Future values can be manually coded, but they are generally returned with packages/APIs.
<br /><br />

Future\<someType\>.then((someType) {}) is an instance method allows for handling after the Future is completed with a value. 
- The .then() method takes a function that can take a value of \<someType\> and perform operations directly on the value. Afterwards, the .then will return another Future\<someOtherType\> or just void.
  - This means .then() methods can be chained since they all return a Future\<T\>, even if they're different ones.
- To handle errors, there's also a .catchError(), which is like .then() but with an error. There is also a .whenCompleted(), similar to the `finally` in a try-catch block.

- FutureBuilder\<T\>(future Future\<T\>, builder (context, snapshot) {}) is a builder than rebuilds when the Future\<T\> is completed. This allows Futures to be used in widgets. Futures are *one use async functions*, so they'll only run once.
  - A snapshot is the current state of the Future.
  - Example: 
```FutureBuilder<String>(
  future: _fetchNetworkData, builder: (context, snapshot) {
    if (snapshot.hasError) {
      print("There was an error");

    } else if (snapshot.hasData) {
      print("${snapshot.data}");

    } else {
      print("Still waiting on a value");

    }
  })
  ```
<br /><br />

A Stream\<T\> like a Future\<T\> but it delivers 0+ values over time. This means its states are 0 values, 1 value, 2 values (and/or errors)... ...completed.
- You can "subscribe" to a Stream\<someType\> with a listener variable, like `final subscription = Stream\<T\>.listen((someType) {})`, where the function inside .listen() is performed on every value that it delivers instead of just 1 in .then().
  - .listen() takes an optional onError method of (error) {} to handle errors (*this exists with .then() too, so two options there*) and an onDone method when the Stream finishes (which it doesn't always do, depending on the situation).
  - .listen() returns a StreamSubscription\<T\>, not Stream\<T\>, which is unlike .then(), which also returns Future\<T\>.
- You can also .pause(), .resume(), and .cancel() data flow with the listener variable (subscription)

- Various methods can be attached to a Stream\<T\>, such as .where() to return data that meets a boolean test or .map() to turn the Stream\<T\> into a Stream<R> of different values.
- A StreamBuilder\<T\>(stream Stream\<T\>, builder (context, builder) {}) is like a FutureBuilder but it rebuilds every time a new value is delivered.
  - snapshot.connectionState is a field of the Snapshot has to see whether the stream is still waiting, finished, etc.
<br /><br />

'async' and 'await' are keywords that let to make asynchronous code more readable and like synchronous code.
- async goes just before the opening brace of the function that will use await.
- await goes before every Future\<T\> the function waits for.
- Error handling happens with a try-catch block.

## Performance
- Quizzes (LIST): iterating through all in fromMap, order semi-important, displaying all, each has index associated for page
- Questions (LIST): iterating through all in fromMap, displaying all, order unimportant
- QuizStates (MAP): associated with a quiz name, iterating through app, order unimportant, need to find and access by name
- User (MAP): associated with an email

## Things I Did Well and Future Advice
- (Advice) Organize: this TODO file, lots of time spent standardizing UI, refactoring code, and this improved my speed and avoided so many errors (One of the recent larger bugs was actually fixed w/ refactoring and improved app architecture)
  - (Advice) Planning: the planning at the start really helped, and I'd created "MVP"s for each future section
- (Challenge) Balancing Learning and Creating: most of the learning happens as you go, but there were some things I learned beforehand, like async, database connections, JSON, and state management
  - I revisited a lot of my old methods and improved them once I better understood my work
- Debugging (Advice & Process): there are multiple tools in Flutter, DevTools great for UI, lots of debugPrints, debug console helpful most of the time but a few errors that I could not find anything for

- I'd recommend working with Flutter and React Native because they have good documentation (especially Flutter) and a low learning curve
- This project was actually smooth overall (setup was a little hard), I struggled a lot more with my FBLA app
  - Going to continue working on this project, developing a pilot and question collection program (show script)

  - Excel will give an output from script, and I can then copy-paste into another project that I use to write code.

# Known "Errors"
- If user cancels the email verification page within 5 seconds of sending the email verification, then the app crashes (This is because of an async wait function running to avoid the user from spamming emails; will fix later).
- Any new data from updated in the database externally only updates every time the user logs in/reloads (esp for the leaderboard)
- COMMON FIX: Methods compile without () but cause problems (one is a reference, one is a call)
- Some new users are being handled as current users --> no Firestore doc created
