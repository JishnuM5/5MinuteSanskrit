## Features:
### Weekly Quizzes with Spaced Repetition
* Quiz-Session Organization: weekly split into "sessions" of 5 daily questions, each taking only 3-5 minutes to answer

* Users are motivated to answer questions on time, supported by the UI and points system

### Intuitive and Consistent Interface

### Quiz and Environment Personalization
* Hint Pages: Custom hint pages can be chosen or created for various topics, providing a quick lesson or review
* Could Storage: All user, quiz, and hint data is safely stored to a Firestore Database. Firebase manages user authentication, too.
* Coming Soon: I'm currently working on developing a classroom environment that enables teachers to create and assign quizzes and track student progress
